CMake syntax
============

.. questions::

   - How can we achieve more control over the build system generated by CMake?
   - Is it possible to let the user decide what to generate?


.. objectives::

   - Learn the syntax for conditionals in CMake: |if| - ``elseif`` - ``else`` - ``endif``
   - Learn the syntax for loops in CMake: |foreach|
   - Learn how CMake structures build artifacts.
   - Learn how to print helpful messages.
   - Learn how to handle user-facing options: |option| and the role of the CMake cache.


CMake offers a *domain-specific language* (DSL) to describe how to generate a
build system native to the specific platform you might be running on.
In this episode, we will get acquainted with its syntax.


The CMake DSL
-------------

Remember that the DSL is *case-insensitive*. We will now have a look at its main elements.


Commands
++++++++

These are provided by CMake and are the essential building blocks of the DSL, as they allow you to manipulate variables.
They include control flow constructs and the ``target_*`` family of commands.
You can find a complete list of available commands with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cmake --help-command-list

**Functions** and **macros** are build on top of the basic built-in commands and
are either CMake- or user-defined.
These prove useful to avoid repetition in your CMake scripts.
The difference between a function and a macro is their *scope*:

1. Functions have their own scope: variables defined inside a function are not
   propagated back to the caller.
2. Macros do not have thei own scope: variables from the parent scope can be
   modified and new variables in the parent scope can be set.


Help on a specific built-in command, function or macro can be obtained with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cmake --help-command target_link_libraries



Modules
+++++++

These are collections of functions and macros and are either CMake- or user-defined.
CMake comes with a rich ecosystem of modules and you will probably write a few
of your own to encapulate frequently used functions or macros in your CMake
scripts.
You will have to include the module to use its contents, for example:

.. code-block:: cmake

   include(CMakePrintHelpers)


The full list of built-in modules is available with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cmake --help-module-list


Help on a specific built-in module can be obtained with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cmake --help-module CMakePrintHelpers




Flow control
------------

The |if| and |foreach| commands are available as flow control constructs in the
CMake DSL and you are surely familiar with their use in other programming
languages.

Since *all* variables in CMake are strings, the syntax for |if| and |foreach|
appears in a few different variants.

.. signature:: |if|

   .. code-block:: cmake

      if(<condition>)
        # <commands>
      elseif(<condition>) # optional block, can be repeated
        # <commands>
      else()              # optional block
        # <commands>
      endif()

The truth value of the conditions in the |if| and ``elseif`` blocks is
determined by boolean operators. In the CMake DSL:

- True is any expression evaluating to: ``1``, ``ON``, ``TRUE``, ``YES``, and
  ``Y``.
- False is any expression evaluating to: ``0``, ``OFF``, ``FALSE``, ``NO``,
  ``N``, ``IGNORE``, and ``NOTFOUND``.

CMake offers boolean operator for string comparisons, such as ``STREQUAL`` for
string equality, and for version comparisons, such as ``VERSION_EQUAL``.

.. callout:: Variable expansions in conditionals

   The |if| command expands the contents of variables before evaluating their
   truth value.
   See the `official documentation
   <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/if.html?highlight=#variable-expansion>`_
   for further details.


You can perform the same operation on a collection of items with |foreach|:

.. signature:: |foreach|

   .. code-block:: cmake

      foreach(<loop_var> <items>)
        # <commands>
      endforeach()

The list of items is either space- or ;-separated. ``break()`` and
``continue()`` are also available.


The build tree
++++++++++++++

It is instructive to browse the build folder for the project we built in the
previous typealong:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ tree -L 2 build

   build
   ├── CMakeCache.txt
   ├── CMakeFiles
   │   ├── 3.18.4
   │   ├── cmake.check_cache
   │   ├── CMakeDirectoryInformation.cmake
   │   ├── CMakeOutput.log
   │   ├── CMakeTmp
   │   ├── compute-areas.dir
   │   ├── geometry.dir
   │   ├── Makefile2
   │   ├── Makefile.cmake
   │   ├── progress.marks
   │   └── TargetDirectories.txt
   ├── cmake_install.cmake
   ├── compute-areas
   ├── libgeometry.a
   └── Makefile

We note that:

- The project was configured with ``Makefile`` generator.
- The cache is a plain-text file ``CMakeCache.txt``.
- For every target in the project, CMake will create a subfolder
  ``<target>.dir`` under ``CMakeFiles``. The intermediate object files are
  stored in these folders, together with compiler flags and link line.
- The build artifacts, ``compute-areas`` and ``libgeometry.a``,  are stored at
  the root of the build tree.


Controlling the build with options
----------------------------------

We mentioned earlier that the ``-D`` switch in the command-line interface (CLI)
of the ``cmake`` command can be used to pass options, but how do we define these
options in our ``CMakeLists.txt``?
That is where the |option| comes into play!

.. signature:: |option|

   .. code-block:: cmake

      option(<variable> "<help_text>" [value])

   With this, you can provide an ON/OFF toggle controllable from the CLI.

By importing the ``CMakeDependentOption`` module, you can handle cases where
options are only relevant *if* other options are already set to specific values:

.. signature:: |cmake_dependent_option|

   .. code-block:: cmake

      cmake_dependent_option(USE_FOO "Use Foo" ON
                             "USE_BAR;NOT USE_ZOT" OFF)

  If the option ``USE_BAR`` is true and  the option ``USE_ZOT`` is false, then
  an option ``USE_FOO`` will be presented to the user and it will be true by
  default. If the condition on ``USE_BAR`` and ``USE_ZOT`` is not realized, the
  option is set to false.


.. keypoints::

   - CMake offers a full-fledged DSL which empowers you to write complex ``CMakeLists.txt``.
   - Variables have scoping rules.
   - The structure of the project is mirrored in the build folder.
